Preload templates:
	Program starts out with a random seed unless the user specifies a template.
	Templates can be loaded by adding opening a matrix file, usually with a file extension ".lif"
Sample ".lif" file (Creates R-pentomino):
0,0,0,0,0
0,0,1,1,0
0,1,1,0,0
0,0,1,0,0
0,0,0,0,0


Command line arguments:
	
	--thread [threads]   Set how many threads to process the buffer with (default 2)
	
	-t [Refresh time]    Set the minimum refresh time in milliseconds    (default 200ms)

	-n                   Shows the underlying array

	-i [iterations]      Set the max number of generations to iterate    (default 1000)

	-g                   Set the preloaded seed for glider               (default random)

	-f [.lif file]       Set to load seed from passed in file
